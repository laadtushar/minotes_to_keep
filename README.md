# minotes_to_keep
So I shifted from MI device to SAMSUNG and I wanted to transfer my 300+ Mi Notes to Google keep.
Now after searching for a way for 1 week I came to the conclusion that the only was to do this is to copy-paste one by one or create a python bot.

I am making a python bot that will scrape Mi notes from Mi cloud and create a note in my google keep account.i I am using Selenium library in Python.
